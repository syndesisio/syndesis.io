## Syndesis looks awesome. Who is it for?
Anyone that wants to integrate services. Syndesis includes a swish UI that enables the user to design integration flows and manage them from their browser.

No coding required... Unless you really want to and then Syndesis allows you to dive into the code, develop your own connectors (if one doesn't already exist), or hack on the integration definition directly.
