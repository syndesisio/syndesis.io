The Integration Platform That’s For Everyone - No Coding Required. Best of All? Syndesis runs in the cloud or on-premise, on OpenShift or Kubernetes.
</p>

The week before Red Hat Summit is always crazy, seemingly endless demo recordings, and lots of blood, sweat, and tears. So many tears. Even more so when your project is going to have it's first public airing. And so our team is ecstatic to announce the release of Syndesis, a game-changing data integration platform that can be run in the cloud, requires no code whatsoever (but can be extended, should you be so inclined), and, in typical Red Hat fashion, is completely open source.

Not a fan of coding? We understand... kind of. We designed and built Syndesis with our users in mind. We wanted to make it possible for everyone to use without having to hound the developer on shift, or sift through dozens of lines of code. It leverages the powerful functionality and flexibility of Camel, an embeddable data integration platform, without the technical complexity of setting it up and using it.

Syndesis provides you with a user-friendly interface you can easily navigate like any other web application, except this isn’t just any web application--it’s a powerful platform that you can use to integrate the services you use regularly to complete your day-to-day business operations much more easily. You can even add steps in between these integrations to map or log data.

Java devs will be happy to hear that the magic that allows this data integration to happen so seamlessly is the beloved Apache Camel. In some ways, you can think of Syndesis as a simple Camel UI with the same powerful functionality, which means you can create new connectors in a snap if we don’t support them OOTB. Syndesis also has the ability to be run on the newly released OpenShift Online, so you will be able to run your applications as completely cloud-based and container-native. How cool is that?

Syndesis is simple to deploy on OpenShift or Kubernetes; so it is completely up to you whether you want to run it on your choice of cloud provider or even on-premise.

We are eager to hear feedback, so please let us know what your thoughts are by [contacting us](contact).
