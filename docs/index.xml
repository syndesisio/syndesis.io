      <description>Buildtool &amp;ldquo;syndesis&amp;rdquo; Syndesis uses a single tool for controlling various aspects of the build and developer related tasks. This script can be found in $SYNDESIS_DIR/tools/bin and is called syndesis. It requires bash and can be used on any Unix or macOS.
To have this script handy all the time it is recommended to either put this bin/ directory into the path or add a symlink from syndesis into a directory which is already on your execution path.</description>

      <description>Heads up! This is a work in progress... and may always be... Please check back regularly.  The Syndesis maintainers are always looking for the optimum way to develop Syndesis. We aim to have a development process that enables fast delivery across all features and components, taking into account priorities from the community. Speed of development has to be balanced against total community ownership, knowledge sharing, and stability of the software.</description>

      <description>There are many ways to contribute to Syndesis. All contributions are valued and welcomed, be it fixing a typo in documentation, raising an issue to report a bug, or creating a whole new awesome feature. Don&amp;rsquo;t worry if this is your first contribution to an open source project: the Syndesis maintainers can help you if you need it.
Improving documentation Documentation is in various places in our repositories. We are committed to streamlining this, but for now there are a few different places to look.</description>

      <description>This document want to illustrates at high level some of the components that makes up Syndesis and how they are communicating together to finally serves the creation of an integration. We are using Apache Camel as a runtime target, though it would be possible to extend the project and makes it suitable to any other integration platform.
Disclaimer: the content illustrated here is related to version 1.8, it can change in future versions.</description>

      <title>Connection Autodiscovery</title>

      <description>Most steps on any integration have an input data source coming from the previous step and output another data source to the following step. Each type of connector expects different data sources. These data source formats are the ones used on the mapping steps to match the output of one step to the input of the following step.
But sometimes we don&amp;rsquo;t have a pre-defined format for those data sources, but a format that is dependent on the context.</description>

      <title>Connector Schema</title>

      <description>As we&amp;rsquo;ve already seen in the Connector Development guidelines, the connection to or from a generic data source is proxied by the presence of the Connector Proxy component. In this page you will find how to configure it in all its details. The descriptor does a fundamental job in linking together the GUI (who will use the configuration to dynamically define the connector behavior), the server, the meta (which can be required to serve certain meta information dynamically) and finally the integration platform runtime where the application will run (being Apache Camel the one we use as reference).</description>

      <title>Data Shapes</title>

      <description>A very important feature of any integration platform is to manage transparently the data format between the source and the destination channel. Syndesis and the powerful visual data mapper tool bundled with it, simplifies this concept with the definition of a datashape.
A datashape is a way to describe any inbound/outbound message format and to allow the user to easily map each data property in the integration step: said in other words, you will be able to transform on the fly the input/output of the data involved in an integration.</description>

      <description>Minishift We are assuming an existing Minishift instance.
Startup Make sure Minishift is running.
$ minishift status Which should look like:
$ minishift status Minishift: Running If it says something like:
$ minishift status Minishift: Stopped Then start minishift with:
$ minishift start Environment This step is required regardless of whether it’s a first-time install or not. It logs you in and points OpenShift to use Minishift resources.
$ oc login -u developer $ eval $(minishift oc-env) $ eval $(minishift docker-env) The eval’s set a number of environment variables, like change the $PATH and $DOCKER_HOST, so each time you do a Syndesis build it’s good to make sure those are invoked.</description>

      <title>Development QuickStart</title>

      <description>If you’d like to get a local development environment up and running, for both the UI and REST API, this is how you’d do it.
Tips
 Build on branch, not master. Callback URL Example: https://syndesis.192.168.64.29.nip.io/api/v1/credentials/callback  Requirements You can follow these steps if it’s your first time setting up Syndesis, or if you want a fresh local installation to replace an existing one. Some environment-specific instructions may be available below as well.</description>

      <title>How to develop a connector</title>

      <description>If Syndesis does not provide a connector for the application or service that you want to connect to in an integration, an experienced developer can develop and contribute a new Syndesis connector.
This documentation provides details about developing, testing, and deploying a new Syndesis connector. It uses the example of creating the MongoDB connector to illustrate internal behavior and analyze development choices.
Before you start to develop a connector, you should:</description>

      <description>Maven Groups Syndesis uses Maven as build tool. Maven groups are used to separate the various Syndesis parts.
In details Syndesis consists of the following groups:
   Group Package Docker Image Description     common io.syndesis.common  Syndesis shared common module   connector io.syndesis.connector  Supported connectors   dv io.syndesis.dv  Tool that manages dynamic VDBs for the Teiid OpenShift Deployment.   extension io.</description>

      <title>Troubleshooting</title>

      <description>Common Problems When things go wrong, you want to try to identify the area that is causing problems (UI, REST API, etc). If it’s the UI, look for errors in the browser console or the terminal to see if it’s a dependency issue.
UI Dependency Issues $ rm -rf node_modules $ yarn install Not getting latest API changes This is a known issue. This is the workaround for using the latest REST image from the Docker stream.</description>
